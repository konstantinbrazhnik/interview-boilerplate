Once the admission requirements are met the prospective member may be put up to a vote of the full {{TOKEN}} membership. {{NAME}} will consistently review, and if necessary {{TOKEN}} members can make adjustments to the admission requirements based on its evolving needs.  Current path to initiate a proposal to join membership and  to signal members for a vote can be found in the {{NAME}} Handbook, and may be updated from time to time.

**Section 2.3 - Rights.** {{NAME}} Members shall utilize the “Designated Smart Contract” (a smart contract deployed to the Designated Blockchain at the Designated Blockchain Address (currently an Aragon application) as the exclusive method of holding, allocating among the {{TOKEN}} Members, and spending, or otherwise distributing any Tokens that are {{NAME}} property, of minting and issuing {{TOKEN}} Membership Tokens and holding and recording votes of the {{TOKEN}} Members. {{NAME}} may also utilize the Designated Smart Contract to administer and facilitate certain other arrangements and transactions involving {{NAME}}, the {{TOKEN}} Members and/or third parties.

{{NAME}} Members’ rights and responsibilities are controlled by the use of the Designated Smart Contact used to conduct its governance and {{NAME}} activities. {{NAME}}'s Aragon Agent is located at {{NAME}}’s designated Ethereum Web3 address **({{DAO-ADDRESS}})** through {{NAME}} governance to act on behalf of {{NAME}}, to contract on behalf of the DAO through a {{TOKEN}} membership vote.  {{TOKEN}} members will cast votes and carry out the decisions made on the Designated Smart Contract.  {{TOKEN}} tokens are held in Account Addresses, key paired wallets controlled by {{TOKEN}} Members in a designated hexadecimal address (“Member Web3 Account”). The registry of Member Web3 Account addresses holding {{TOKEN}} governance tokens of {{NAME}} can be found here: {{DAO ADDRESS}}.

**Section 2.4 - Responsibilities.** By accepting and retaining membership each applicant shall agree to use the services of {{NAME}} on at least an occasional basis.

To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, no {{TOKEN}} Member shall be (or shall be deemed to be) liable for any liability of the {{NAME}} or any other {{TOKEN}} Member. This shall not (and shall not be deemed to) create or imply any obligation of {{NAME}} or any {{TOKEN}} Member to indemnify or compensate any {{TOKEN}} Member from, or hold any {{TOKEN}} Member harmless against, any Liabilities incurred by such DAO Member under any applicable law, in connection with the {{TOKEN}} Member's participation in {{NAME}} or otherwise.

Notice of votes can be set up by {{TOKEN}} holders via the Designated Smart Contract and when votes are triggered in {{NAME}}.chat.  Notices of meetings shall also be posted on {{NAME}}’s official social media and {{NAME}}.chat including the member information roster, but the inadvertent failure to do so shall not affect the validity of the meeting. Any business conducted at a meeting of members other than that specified in the notice of the meeting shall be of an advisory nature only.

**Section 3.5 - Quorum.** The {{NAME}} Handbook (“Handbook”) shall provide a written explanation of the voting mechanism and voting quorum requirements of {{NAME}}.

## Article V - Governance Shares and Capital Shares

**Section 5.1 - Issuance and terms.** It is noted that different Designated Smart Contracts have different manners of managing governance shares (“{{TOKEN}}”) versus contributed capital and efforts resulting in retains to {{NAME}} (“Loot Shares”).  Currently, {{TOKEN}} members have no rights of redemption of any working capital, or token assets, held within {{NAME}}.  In the future, to evidence capital or contributions of efforts provided by members, the Co-op may issue “Loot Shares”. Loot Shares may be issued only to persons eligible for and admitted to membership in {{NAME}}. Loot Shares shall be considered issued upon their issue and they need not be evidenced by certificates.  Loot Shares shall be entitled to no dividend or other monetary return on contributed capital and may not be used to secure loans or other obligations of members. Loot Shares shall be subject to assessment for the reasonable capital needs of {{NAME}}, as determined by mutual agreement.  Loot Shares (if issued) should be considered to be similar to “retains” and are envisioned as a manner of tracking contributions made to the nonprofit.  It is not anticipated that {{NAME}} will ever turn a “profit” as excess capital will be paid out via charitable donations, grants, or other forms of support meant to carry out the Mission Statement.

**Section 5.2 - Redemption.** Upon request following termination of {{NAME}} membership or via a future Smart Contract Mechanism to remove capital via a burn of Loot Shares, the Loot Shares shall be redeemed via a mechanism to be determined by {{TOKEN}} members.  A “Rage Quit” is a request to burn both {{TOKEN}} Membership token and Loot Shares. A “Loot Quit”, is simply to burn and withdraw Loot Shares as return of retains.  Loot Shares (if ever created) shall be redeemable at the approved Designated Smart Contract less a reasonable processing fee (if any).

## Article VI - Guild Kick/Member Removal and Exit

**Section 7.1 - Distribution obligation.** The realized net earnings of {{NAME}} attributable to the patronage of members through contributions and voting shall be allocated and distributed among members in proportion to their patronage and in such a manner and at such a time as to constitute patronage dividends within the meaning of federal income tax law. Unless otherwise required under federal tax law all of the operations of the {{NAME}} shall be netted into a single allocation unit.

**Section 7.2 - Reductions.** Any distributable net earnings of such a nominal amount as not to justify the expenses of distribution may, as determined by the {{NAME}} Advisory Group pr {{TOKEN}} Members, be excluded from distribution.

A patronage dividend to which members are entitled may be waived in whole or in part by vote of members.

**Section 7.3 - Consent of members.** By obtaining or retaining membership in {{NAME}}, each member shall there by consent to take into account, in the manner and to the extent required by Section 1385 of the Internal Revenue Code, the stated dollar amount of any qualified written notice of allocation in the taxable year in which such notice is received.

**Section 7.4 - Deferred amounts.** Payment of patronage dividends may be deferred for the reasonable capital needs of {{NAME}}, as determined by {{TOKEN}} Members. Such amounts shall accrue no dividend or other monetary return on capital. Deferred patronage dividends may be redeemed when determined by {{TOKEN}} Members to be no longer needed for capital purposes.

**Section 7.5 - Net losses.** No portion of a net operating loss realized by the Cooperative shall be allocated to members. The patronage portion of such losses shall be carried forward to offset patronage-sourced income of subsequent years. The non patronage portion of such losses shall be carried back and forward to offset non patronage-sourced income of prior and subsequent years as required or permitted under federal income tax law. As a nonprofit unincorporated association, it is not anticipated there will be tax returns or profits.

**Section 7.6 - Failure to Claim or Redeem.** The patronage dividend distributed to any member, by any means, including as cash, as a voucher, or by digital asset may be used for the purchase of {{NAME}} items and services, or donated to {{NAME}}. The portion of a patronage dividend distributed to any member that is not claimed, used, redeemed or donated within 90 days of issuance date, or by the next June 30th from issuance date, whichever is later, shall potentially revert to {{NAME}} as a donation without further notice to the member. Such portions of patronage dividends that are donated or that revert to {{NAME}} as provided in this subsection shall be distributed and allocated to a tax-exempt charity or grant as the {{TOKEN}} Members may determine.
